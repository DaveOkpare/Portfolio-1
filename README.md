Hi, my name is Harrison.


I am a graduate student and researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas studying computer science. I am passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and web app development.	

I am a pragmatist at heart, I believe in the importance of applying machine learning to make a difference in the world. This means writing about my experiences as a self-taught Data Scientist as well as applying my models in real-world production systems.

### [Experiment: Batch Norm vs. Dropout in ConvNets](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Portfolio/blob/master/Experiment-BatchNorm-vs-Dropout/08-12-18%20Batch%20Norm%20vs%20Dropout.ipynb)

<p>
An experiment testing whether convolutional neural networks with dropout or batch norm are more performant in image recognition tasks. The <a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Portfolio/blob/master/Experiment-BatchNorm-vs-Dropout/08-12-18%20Batch%20Norm%20vs%20Dropout.ipynb">notebook</a> in this repository is experimental evidence supporting <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-use-dropout-in-convolutional-networks-81486c823c16">the Medium post</a> I wrote explaining how to more effectively build convolutional neural networks.    </p>

<p>
The above blog post has been published and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weekly-selection-aug-17-2018-4ad31bfe7c37">featured</a> in Towards Data Science, with 3K reads on Medium in 2 weeks. It has also been reposted as a guest blog on KDNuggets, a leading site on Analytics, Big Data, Data Science, and Machine Learning, reaching over 500K unique visitors per month and over 230K subscribers/followers via email and social media. </p>

### [Global Average Pooling: Object Localization](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/GAP.html)
<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/GAP.html"><img src="images/hucklecover2.png" height=300 width=300></a></p>
<p>
Reimplementation of  global average pooling in convolutional neural networks for object localization proposed in <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/Zhou_Learning_Deep_Features_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf">this paper</a>. Improved code written by <a href="https://alexisbcook.github.io/2017/global-average-pooling-layers-for-object-localization/">Alexis Cook</a> to handle multi-class localization of images.</p>

### [Apple Sentiment Analysis](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/apple.html)
<p>An implementation of topics I covered while studying Natural Language Processing. In this write-up I cleaned and vectorized text data, visualized and examined pattern in the Twitter data, and created a linear classifier to predict document sentiment w/ 89% accuracy on a validation set.  </p>
<p>
I concluded the project by creating a write-up, posted on <a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/apple.html">my website</a>. In the future, I would like to productionize this NLP model by creating a REST API to allow others access to my predictions.</p>

### [Toxic Topic Modelling](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/toxic.html)
<p>
<b>The Purpose:</b> In this project I used word clouds and topic modelling to analyze a textual dataset. Specifically, I performed LDA clustering on wikipedia forum comments to see if I could isolate clusters of toxic comments.(insults, slurs,...)</p>
<p>
I was largely succesful in isolating toxic comments into one group. Further, I gained valuable knowledge about the discussions held within the forum dataset, labeling forum posts into 9 distinct categories. I found each post could be catagorized as either relevant discussion, side conversations, or outright toxic comments.  </p>

### [Clustering Mental Health](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/Clustering.html)

<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/Clustering.html"><img src="images/Mental_health_clustering.png" height=300 width=300></a></p>
<p>
<p>In this write-up I sought to answer whether a survey of mental health benefits of tech industry employees could be used to cluster employees into groups with good and bad mental health coverage.</p>

<p> By cleaning survey data and performing an exploratory data analysis I was able to analyze the demographics of the tech industry. I found the the average respondent was a male, aged 35, located in the United States. By performing KMeans and agglomerative clustering (with scikit-learn) I attempted to cluster the data, but found the survey setup prevented any meaningful insight into the data.</p>
  
  <p> In completing this project, I learned how to encode categorical data and create an insightful EDA with great visualizations. I also learned how to implement clustering methods on data, and <b> analyze the appropriateness of the clustering method with various techniques.</b>
