I am a graduate student and researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and web app development.	In my spare time I build websites, read research papers, and play Overwatch. I also exercise regularly and play with my german shepherd, Huckleberry.

Tests whether convolutional networks with dropout or batch norm are more performant. The notebook in this repository is experimental evidence supporting <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-use-dropout-in-convolutional-networks-81486c823c16">the Medium post</a> I wrote. (Published in Towards Data Science, 2.3K reads in the first week.)
