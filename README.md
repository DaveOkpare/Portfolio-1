Hi, my name is Harrison Jansma.



<p>Nine months ago I was in a new city at a dead end job. After some serious self reflection about my passions and interests, I commited to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science and the tech industry. I built my own curriculum, a hodgepodge of hundreds of websites and forums, and committed between 4-6 hours each day to learning the basics.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today where I have been enrolled to an excellent computer science program. I now publish my own webpages to help others learn about everything from data science to deep learning. I am so excited by all the things I have learned over the last few months, and I love that I get to work on something I am passionate about each day.</p>

<p>I still have a long way to go though. The next few months I will focus on teaching others and implementing machine learning models in real world production systems. I further hope to get internship experience so I can engage with other like minded people and get more experience building intelligent systems for use in the real  world.</p>



# Get to Know Me 

### My Portfolio Website

<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com"><img src="images/cv_website.PNG"></a></p>
  
  <p> I built the site in HTML, CSS, and Javascript using pieces of an existing design on <a href="https://colorlib.com/">Colorlib</a>. Though I am not interested in Front-End Development, I created and deployed this website on a private <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> server so that I could learn more about web app design and back-end development. I believe that knowledge of <b>both data science and back-end development</b> is the secret to seamless implementation of artificial intelligence in existing web technologies.</p>
  
  <p> In the future I hope to use this website as a nesting ground for web-based computer vision and NLP models. Though I don't expect it to be anything more than a portfolio site, the things I will learn are directly applicable in the tech industry today.</p>

### My Writing
  <p align="center">
<a href="https://medium.com/@harrisonjansma"><img src="images/Medium.PNG"></a></p>
  
  
  <p> All my life I have been an avid sci-fi and fantasy reader.  Very recently I have begun writing about my research, thoughts, and  experiences and publishing them for the world to see. Though my creative output is a work in progress, my blog posts about data science and deep learning have been well received. </p
  
  <p>My first post on Medium led me to be recruited as a Towards Data Science writer.  My second post, a more polished and practical article about deep learning, was <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weekly-selection-aug-17-2018-4ad31bfe7c37">featured</a> in TDS's weekly editorial picks. Three weeks after its initial publication it received 3k reads and was reposted on KDNuggets (A Big Data/Data Science website with over 230k subscribers).</p>

### My Professional Experience
  <p align="center">
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonjansma/"><img src="images/Linkedin.PNG"></a></p>
  
  <p> Since I am twenty-three years old and entering into a masters program, I have little industry experience in data science. I have got around this lack of access by making my own production systems.</p>
  <p>Thanks largely to the availability of cheap computational resources, I have deployed several servers on DigitalOcean to host my website, build Machine learning enviornments, and house databases. By doing this I have gained practical real-world experience that is highly relevant in industry.</p>


# My Work
The following are my personal projects. For a more complete (and aesthetically appealing) list of my work, please check out my <a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com">portfolio website</a>. Which not only includes these projects, but also my Medium publications and computer vision (deep learning) research.

### [Experiment: Batch Norm vs. Dropout in ConvNets](https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Portfolio/blob/master/Experiment-BatchNorm-vs-Dropout/08-12-18%20Batch%20Norm%20vs%20Dropout.ipynb)
<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Portfolio/blob/master/Experiment-BatchNorm-vs-Dropout/08-12-18%20Batch%20Norm%20vs%20Dropout.ipynb"><img src="images/dropout.png" height=300 width=300></a></p>
<p>
This experiment tested whether convolutional neural networks with dropout or batch normalization are more performant in image recognition tasks. The <a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Portfolio/blob/master/Experiment-BatchNorm-vs-Dropout/08-12-18%20Batch%20Norm%20vs%20Dropout.ipynb">notebook</a> in this repository is experimental evidence supporting <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-use-dropout-in-convolutional-networks-81486c823c16">the Medium post</a> I wrote explaining how to more effectively build convolutional neural networks.</p>

<p>
The above blog post has been published and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weekly-selection-aug-17-2018-4ad31bfe7c37">featured</a> in Towards Data Science, with 3K reads on Medium in 2 weeks. It has also been reposted as a guest blog on KDNuggets, a leading site on Analytics, Big Data, Data Science, and Machine Learning, reaching over 500K unique visitors per month and over 230K subscribers/followers via email and social media. </p>

### [Global Average Pooling: Object Localization](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/GAP.html)

Object Localization of my dog, Huckleberry.</p>


<p>
In this project I reimplemented the deep learning method for object localization (finding objects in an image) proposed in <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/Zhou_Learning_Deep_Features_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf">this research paper</a>. I implemented and improved code written by <a href="https://alexisbcook.github.io/2017/global-average-pooling-layers-for-object-localization/">Alexis Cook</a> to handle multi-class localization of images.</p>

### [Apple Sentiment Analysis](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/apple.html)
<p>This project was motivated by my drive to learn about the best practices of predictive modelling in text data. In <a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/apple.html">the write-up</a> I cleaned and vectorized Twitter data, visualized and examined patterns, and created a linear classifier to predict document sentiment w/ 89% accuracy on a validation set.  </p>
<p>
I concluded the project by creating a write-up, posted on <a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/apple.html">my website</a>. In the future, I would like to productionize this NLP model by creating a REST API to allow others access to my predictions.</p>

### [Toxic Topic Modelling](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/toxic.html)

<p> In this project I used unsupervised learning to cluster forum discussions. Specifically, I performed LDA clustering on Wikipedia forum comments to see if I could isolate clusters of toxic comments.(insults, slurs,...)</p>
<p>
I was largely succesful in isolating toxic comments into one group. Furthermore, I gained valuable knowledge about the discussions held within the forum dataset, labeling forum posts into 9 distinct categories. These 9 categories could be further grouped as either relevant discussion, side conversations, or outright toxic comments.  </p>

### [Clustering Mental Health](https://www.harrisonjansma.com/Clustering.html)

<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.harrisonjansma.com/Clustering.html"><img src="images/Mental_health_clustering.png" height=300 width=300></a></p>
<p>
<p>In this write-up I sought to answer whether a survey of mental health benefits of tech industry employees could be used to cluster employees into groups with good and bad mental health coverage.</p>

<p> By cleaning survey data and performing an exploratory data analysis I was able to analyze the demographics of the tech industry. I found the the average respondent was a male, aged 35, located in the United States. By performing KMeans and agglomerative clustering (with scikit-learn) I attempted to cluster the data, but found the survey setup prevented any meaningful insight into the data.</p>
  
  <p> In completing this project, I learned how to encode categorical data and create an insightful EDA with great visualizations. I also learned how to implement clustering methods on data, and <b> analyze the appropriateness of the clustering method with various techniques.</b>
